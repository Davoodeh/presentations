* Background

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Emacs lisp is both one of the most exciting and daunting things about Emacs for
me. Before starting to explore Emacs I had never encountered or engaged in lisp
nor in functional programming. So the paradigm was something very non familiar
for me.

This is a an introduction to Emacs lisp, for beginners by an enthusiastic
beginner. So for anyone that haven't dealt that much with Emacs lisp this might
be a good start. I thought I would share some of the knowledge that I have
acquired so far.

** Build from Vim
So background, I have been using Emacs since around march this year. I started
to experiment some with Spacemacs, since I come from a Vim background. But after
two weeks or so I moved on to Doom Emacs which I have been using since then.

I was a happy Vim user

#+BEGIN_NOTES
In the beginning I used Emacs only for taking notes in org-mode and later to do
my git work with magit. I found that this was a good way to ease myself into
using Emacs. I could gradually start use it more and more and now this is my
daily tool.

** Eshell

#+BEGIN_NOTES
So even though I have acquired some understanding about tweaking and customizing
Emacs it has mainly been built upon the internal code in Doom and snippets or
blog posts that I have found on the internet.

But I started to long for learning some elisp so that I could better understand
what was actually happening and to build some useful functionality myself. I am
quite fascinated with workflows. I like contemplating about my behavioural
patterns, do I want to stop or improve some, what I can do differently etc. So I
think the top-down approach that I chose to learn Emacs was right for me.

So this summer I switched from only using zsh to also start using eshell. This
was a conscious decision where one of the driving forces was that since eshell is
elisp it also has access to all the functions in Emacs and it also means I can
write some functions of my own to perform shell tasks.
