* Org-mode, literate programming in Emacs

** Org-mode :emacs:org_mode:

The first thing I will do is to show how an ~.org~ file looks in
fundamental-mode. It's actually nothing more than a text file. To know more
about Org-mode visit the [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode-site]].

*** Content

Here are some of the basics we can have a look at:

- Headings, how to create them and change them
- What kinds of lists are supported
- How tables look like
- TODO:s


**** My favorite things
1) That it's just plain text files
2) It's automatic adjustments

**** Commands

Good to know commands in Org-mode

| Command           | Action          |
|-------------------+-----------------|
| Tab heading       | Demotes heading |
| Shift-Tab heading | Promote heading |
| C-Enter           |                 |
| M-Enter           |                 |

** Literate programming


** Chaining

This is how to create a variable in bash and how to check it's value:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output
MY_NAME="Niklas"
echo $MY_NAME
#+END_SRC

** Composing

Chaining blocks through ~sessions~ is useful for some types of languages like
~python~ and ~shells~. But that is not the only way. For me it can make sense to
make the blocks as small as needed. That might differ depending on context. So
we shall look more into how to compose different blocks. This is a feature
called ~noweb~.


Let's take the previous python example.


** Note taking

** Our own image

I want to build my own [[https://www.docker.com][Docker]] image and deploy an application on that image.
These are the steps to make this happen:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir "/sudo::" :results none
sudo systemctl start docker
#+END_SRC

*** Build an image
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :results output :mkdirp yes
:END:

I would like to build a docker image with ~Python3~ installed so that I can run
my python3 code. I got the inspiration from this [[https://blog.realkinetic.com/building-minimal-docker-containers-for-python-applications-37d0272c52f3][minimal docker image]] example.

**** Requirements

We need to specify the requirements that we are demanding:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
Flask>=0.12,<0.13
flask-restplus>=0.9.2,<0.10
Flask-SSLify>=0.1.5,<0.2
Flask-Admin>=1.4.2,<1.5
gunicorn>=19,<20
#+END_SRC


**** Dockerfile

The ~Dockerfile~ specifying the commands for building the image looks like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
FROM python:3.6-alpine

COPY requirements.txt /

RUN pip install -r /requirements.txt

COPY src/ /app
WORKDIR /app

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
#+END_SRC

**** The application

This is my application that I want to deploy in the docker
#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle docker_image/src/app.py
for i in range(20):
    print "i has the value " + str(i)
#+END_SRC

**** Create the image

Build the image
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir docker_image
docker build -t minimal_python .
#+END_SRC

First we verify that the image is now available among the docker images
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker images
#+END_SRC

Nice, let's try the image
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker run minimal_python
#+END_SRC

** Performance analysis
:PROPERTIES:
#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME: new_presentation_stripped.pdf
#+LaTeX_HEADER: \usepackage{minted}
#+LaTeX_HEADER: \usemintedstyle{paraiso-light}
:END:

Let's make a fun little investigation. Assume we have some data of a signal and
we want to make an algorithm that tracks the 1-d signal. This presentation is a
little bit too short to make a real algorithm and data in so we will fake it
instead

*** Synthesize the data

*** Visualize estimate and truth

*** Performance numbers

A table can be a good way of displaying the data that we have and analyze the
values. Tables in Emacs can use ~calc~ syntax org ~elisp~ code to make the table
formulas.

In order to get the values from the other table I am using [[https://orgmode.org/manual/References.html#index-remote-references-352][remote references]]. To
refer to the values of the other table. The formulas that the table accepts
should either follow the ~calc~ syntax or ~elisp~.

*** Describe the flow


*** Emacs Calc

Now I thought that this article deserved some bonus information about Emacs
calculator. I knew about it before but writing this part got me interested into
knowing more. And I think that it was a good example of one of the aspects that
I love about Org-mode which is to be able to experiment. I found some useful
[[https://github.com/dfeich/org-babel-examples/blob/master/calc/calc.org][calc-babel-examples]] and [[http://ehneilsen.net/notebook/orgExamples/org-examples.html][org-examples]] which I took inspiration from.
