** DONE Org-mode
CLOSED: [2018-11-19 Mon 14:18]

Describe what Org-mode is by showing how a document looks like and go through the following items
- How headings look like
- How lists look like
- What tables look like
- What another type of list looks like

You know what, now I am tired of only having the document but not the mode, let's enable it

~My favorite things in Org-mode~
1) All the automatic expansions
2) And the nice adjustments
