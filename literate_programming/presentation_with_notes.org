* Org-mode and literate programmming

** TODO Org-mode :emacs:org_mode:

The first thing I will do is to show how an ~.org~ file looks in
fundamental-mode. It's actually nothing more than a text file. To know more
about Org-mode visit the [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode-site]].

*** Content

Here are some of the basics we can have a look at:

- Headings, how to create them and change them
- What kinds of lists are supported
- How tables look like
- TODO:s


**** My favorite things
1) That it's just plain text files
2) It's automatic adjustments

**** Commands

Good to know commands in Org-mode

| Command           | Action          |
|-------------------+-----------------|
| Tab heading       | Demotes heading |
| Shift-Tab heading | Promote heading |
| C-Enter           |                 |
| M-Enter           |                 |

** Literate programming


~Ex1~
We are of course not only limited to perform simple operations like
~hello-world~. Here is an example using the ~Eigen~ library and the ~c++17~ compiler.

#+BEGIN_SRC C++ :flags '("-I ~/Dropbox/Code/Eigen" "-std=c++17") :results output
#include <iostream>
#include <Eigen/Dense>
using namespace Eigen;
using namespace std;
int main()
{
  Matrix3d m = Matrix3d::Random();
  m = (m + Matrix3d::Constant(1.2)) * 50;
  cout << "m =" << endl << m << endl;
  Vector3d v(1,2,3);

  cout << "m * v =" << endl << m * v << endl;
}
#+END_SRC

** Chain

This is how to create a variable in bash and how to check it's value:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output
MY_NAME="Niklas"
echo $MY_NAME
#+END_SRC

~Ex2~
Let's create a variable
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
MY_NAME="Niklas"
#+END_SRC

And let's print it's value
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results ouput
echo $MY_NAME
#+END_SRC

~Ex3~
Let's create a variable
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :session session-shell-chain :results silent
MY_NAME="Niklas"
#+END_SRC

And let's print it's value
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :session session-shell-chain :results ouput
echo $MY_NAME
#+END_SRC

*** Example 4
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :session session-python-chain
:END:

~Ex4~
This works with other languages that supports [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop][interactive
repls]](read-eval-print-loop), like Python.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
def calculate_sum(numbers):
    sum = 0
    for number in numbers:
       sum += number

    return sum
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
numbers = [x for x in range(20)]
print("The sum of the numbers is: " + str(calculate_sum(numbers)))
#+END_SRC

** Compose

Chaining blocks through ~sessions~ is useful for some types of languages like
~python~ and ~shells~. But that is not the only way. For me it can make sense to
make the blocks as small as needed. That might differ depending on context. So
we shall look more into how to compose different blocks. This is a feature
called ~noweb~.


Let's take the previous python example.

~Ex5~
This is where we create our function
#+NAME: python-calc
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def calculate_sum(numbers):
    sum = 0
    for number in numbers:
       sum += number

    return sum
#+END_SRC

And here we create the data dn call the function
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :noweb yes
<<python-calc>>
numbers = [x for x in range(20)]
print("The sum of the numbers is: " + str(calculate_sum(numbers)))
#+END_SRC


~Ex6~
Why not mix languages as well, ~python~ and ~elisp~ working together
#+NAME: elisp-max-numbers
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(/ (* 10 (+ 30 5 2)) 5)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :noweb yes
<<python-calc>>
numbers = [x for x in range(<<elisp-max-numbers()>>)]
print("The sum of the numbers is: " + str(calculate_sum(numbers)))
#+END_SRC

** Note taking

~Ex7~
Org-mode is an excellent tool for when studying, especially programming. Taking
notes and experimenting with examples becomes very natural. Here is an example:
[[file:~/org/hacking_notebook.org::*The%20if%20Special%20Form][An introduction to Elisp: The if Special Form]]

** Our own image

I want to build my own [[https://www.docker.com][Docker]] image and deploy an application on that image.
These are the steps to make this happen:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir "/sudo::" :results none
sudo systemctl start docker
#+END_SRC

*** Build an image
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :results output :mkdirp yes
:END:

I would like to build a docker image with ~Python3~ installed so that I can run
my python3 code. I got the inspiration from this [[https://blog.realkinetic.com/building-minimal-docker-containers-for-python-applications-37d0272c52f3][minimal docker image]] example.

**** Requirements

~Ex8~
We need to specify the requirements that we are demanding:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
Flask>=0.12,<0.13
flask-restplus>=0.9.2,<0.10
Flask-SSLify>=0.1.5,<0.2
Flask-Admin>=1.4.2,<1.5
gunicorn>=19,<20
#+END_SRC

**** Dockerfile

The ~Dockerfile~ specifying the commands for building the image looks like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
FROM python:3.6-alpine

COPY requirements.txt /

RUN pip install -r /requirements.txt

COPY src/ /app
WORKDIR /app

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
#+END_SRC

~Ex9~
~From~ create a layer from the ~python:3.6-alpine~ image:
#+NAME: dockerfile-from
#+BEGIN_SRC text
FROM python:3.6-alpine
#+END_SRC

~Copy~ adds files from your Docker client's current directory
#+NAME: dockerfile-copy
#+BEGIN_SRC text
COPY requirements.txt /
#+END_SRC

~Run~ builds your application with ~make~
#+NAME: dockerfile-run
#+BEGIN_SRC text
RUN pip install -r /requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

~Cmd~ specifies what command to run within the container
#+NAME: dockerile-cmd
#+BEGIN_SRC text
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
#+END_SRC


The Dockerfile then becomes:
#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle docker_image/Dockerfile :noweb yes
<<dockerfile-from>>

<<dockerfile-copy>>

<<dockerfile-run>>

COPY src/ /app
WORKDIR /app

<<dockerfile-cmd>>
#+END_SRC

**** The application

This is my application that I want to deploy in the docker
#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle docker_image/src/app.py
for i in range(20):
    print "i has the value " + str(i)
#+END_SRC

**** Create the image

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir docker_image
docker build -t minimal_python .
#+END_SRC

First we verify that the image is now available among the docker images
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker images
#+END_SRC

Nice, let's try the image
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker run minimal_python
#+END_SRC

*** Improve it

~Ex10~
Start our docker image:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :session session-docker-background
docker run -it minimal_python /bin/sh
#+END_SRC

Verify that it runs:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output
docker ps
#+END_SRC

~Ex11~
I want to have a function which can return to me a TRAMP compliant path to a
running docker image. Implementing that in Emacs lisp can look like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun docker-match (name-regexp)
  ;; return the name of the last docker image which matches the input
  ;; NAME-REGEXP
  (with-temp-buffer (shell-command "docker ps" t)
                    (goto-char (point-min))
                    (let ((name-match '()))
                      (while (not (eobp))
                        (let ((current-name (string-trim (thing-at-point 'line))))
                          (if (string-match name-regexp current-name)
                              (progn
                                (end-of-line)
                                (setq name-match (format "%s" (thing-at-point 'symbol))))))
                        (forward-line 1))
                      name-match)))

(defun docker-path (name-regexp  &optional extended-path)
  (if extended-path
      (format "/docker:%s:/%s" (docker-match name-regexp) extended-path)
    (format "/docker:%s:/" (docker-match name-regexp))))

(docker-path "minimal_python")
#+END_SRC

~Ex12~
Create a session which runs from inside the docker. Here we utilize the function
we just added to set the :dir. This utilizes TRAMP to execute the block inside
the Docker image.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :session session-docker-agent :dir (my/docker-path "minimal_python")
ls
#+END_SRC

~Ex13~
We can now tangle the file directly into the running image
#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle (my/docker-path "minimal_python" "app/app.py")
for i in range(20):
    print("i has the value " + str(i))
#+END_SRC

~Ex14~
Now we want to run a block in the previous session ~session-docker-agent~. When
I held this presentation there was a question on how to create a block which can
automatically use the same session as the previous session in the file.

Now that was a really good question. The solution that I came up with later is
worth showing here I think cause it also highlights the strengths of Emacs and
lisp. I decided to create a function that can find the previous header argument

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun org-babel-previous-session ()
  "Find the previous src code block which contains the session argument and
return it together with the language"
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (let ((session nil)
          (language nil))
      (while (and (re-search-backward org-babel-src-block-regexp nil t) (not session))
        (goto-char (match-beginning 0))
        (let* ((block-info (org-babel-get-src-block-info))
               (block-lang (nth 0 block-info))
               (block-params (nth 2 block-info))
               (block-session (cdr (assoc :session block-params))))
          (unless (string= "none" block-session)
            (setq session block-session)
            (setq language block-lang))))
      (format "%s :session %s" language session))))

(org-babel-previous-session)
#+END_SRC

~Ex15~
Snippets in Emacs are very powerful:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# -*- mode: snippet -*-
# name: previous-session-block
# key: <ss
# --

#+BEGIN_SRC
$0
#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Performance analysis
:PROPERTIES:
#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME: presentation.pdf
#+LaTeX_HEADER: \usepackage{minted}
#+LaTeX_HEADER: \usemintedstyle{paraiso-light}
:END:

Let's make a fun little investigation. Assume we have some data of a signal and
we want to make an algorithm that tracks the 1-d signal. This presentation is a
little bit too short to make a real algorithm and data in so we will fake it
instead

*** Synthesize the data

~Ex16~
There is not room here for creating our own algorithm, so instead we will fake
the truth and estimates. To generate the true signal and the estimate we will
use a block of elisp code.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results value table :exports both
  (mapcar (lambda (i)
            (list i (+ (random 4) (- i 2))))
          (number-sequence 1 20))
#+END_SRC

~Ex17~
In order to get the table of data more comprehensive we utilize another block to
post process the result. This block adds a header to the table.

#+name: add-header
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :var tbl=""
(cons 'hline (cons '("Truth" "Estimate") (cons 'hline tbl)))
#+end_src

*** Visualize estimate and truth

~Ex18~
Here is some python code which can plot data using the matplotlib. So as a
variable to this code block we will pass the numbers from the ~est-truth-data~ block.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session my-plot-session :var data=est-truth-data :results file :exports both
import numpy as np
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Convert list to numpy array
# The need for using 1 index here is because I added the box around truth and
# estimate in the table so it interprests the first value to be truth and estimate
truth = np.asarray(data)[1:, 0]
est = np.asarray(data)[1:, 1]
# Plot
fig=plt.figure()
plt.plot(truth, color="g", label="Truth")
plt.plot(est, marker="x", label="Estimate")
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.xlabel("Sample")
plt.ylabel("Value")
plt.title("Tracking")
plt.savefig('.images/est_vs_truth.png')
'.images/est_vs_truth.png' # return this to org-mode
#+END_SRC

Cool, the performance of the fake algorithm is not that bad. I think we can be
pretty happy with it. let's see if we can gather some more information about
it's performance.

~Ex19~
It's of course possible to use other languages for plotting like ~Octave~
#+BEGIN_SRC octave :results file :var data=est-truth-data[1:-1, 0:1] :exports results
truth = data(:, 1)
estimate = data(:, 2)
samples = linspace(1, 20, length(data))'

figure( 1, "visible", "off" );
hold on
plot(samples, truth, 'g-')
plot(samples, estimate, 'r-x')
print -dpng .images/performance.png -S400;
ans = ".images/performance.png";
#+END_SRC

*** Performance numbers

A table can be a good way of displaying the data that we have and analyze the
values. Tables in Emacs can use ~calc~ syntax org ~elisp~ code to make the table
formulas.

#+CAPTION: Evaluation numbers

In order to get the values from the other table I am using [[https://orgmode.org/manual/References.html#index-remote-references-352][remote references]]. To
refer to the values of the other table. The formulas that the table accepts
should either follow the ~calc~ syntax or ~elisp~.

~Ex20~
To calculate the mean value we can define a code block like this
#+NAME: mean
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :var error=0 :exports none
(let ((num-values (length error)))
  (/ (seq-reduce '+ error 0.0) num-values))
#+END_SRC

And reference it in the table formula

~Ex21~
Any code block can of course be used, not only the ones of ~elisp~. This is
~python~ block which calculates the ~rmse~ value:
#+NAME: rmse
#+BEGIN_SRC python :var estimate=0 :var truth=0 :exports none
import numpy as np
error = np.asarray(estimate) - np.asarray(truth)
result = np.sqrt(np.mean(np.square(error)))
return result
#+END_SRC

*** Describe the flow

~Ex22~
I would like to describe the flow better. It would be great if we could
visualize it, perhaps in a flow chart.
#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file .images/flow.png :exports results
@startuml
(*) --> "Synthesize data with Elisp"

if "Improve results with post" then
  -->[Visualize the data] "Python and matplotlib"
else
  ->[Process the data] "Table formulas"
  -->[Elisp, calc and code blocks] "Visualize the flow"
  -->[plantUML] (*)
endif
@enduml
#+END_SRC

*** Emacs Calc

Now I thought that this article deserved some bonus information about Emacs
calculator. I knew about it before but writing this part got me interested into
knowing more. And I think that it was a good example of one of the aspects that
I love about Org-mode which is to be able to experiment. I found some useful
[[https://github.com/dfeich/org-babel-examples/blob/master/calc/calc.org][calc-babel-examples]] and [[http://ehneilsen.net/notebook/orgExamples/org-examples.html][org-examples]] which I took inspiration from.


Yes we can!
#+BEGIN_SRC calc
fsolve(x*2+x=4,x)
#+END_SRC

~Ex23~

Calc is available in tables as well
| Expression | Derivative |
|------------+------------|
| sqrt(x)    |            |
| cos(x)     |            |
| x^2        |            |
| 1/x^2      |            |

~Ex24~
Another great feature in Emacs is that if you are not happy with something,
change it. So I want a function that actually fix it at runtime.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun org-latex-export-to-pdf-and-open ()
"Export current buffer to LaTeX then process through to PDF and open the
resulting file"
  (interactive)
  (let* ((file-name (file-name-nondirectory buffer-file-name))
        (name (file-name-sans-extension file-name)))
  (org-latex-export-to-pdf)
  (find-file (concat name ".pdf"))))
